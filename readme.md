# Let's build a Interpreter

## Project
This repo contains a WIP Pascal Interpreter, made with Ruby and following the _Let's Build a Interpreter_ blog posts from Ruslan Spivak on https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbasi-part1/

## Intent
This is entirely done with educational purposes, to learn the concepts involved in creating a programming language like _Abstract Syntax Trees_, _Context Free Grammars_, _Parsers_, _Interpreters_, and so on.

## Structure
Each filename ends in a number corresponding to the related post in the series, with all exercises done.
